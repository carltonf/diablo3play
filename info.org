* Decision Helpers
** TODO Marginal Benefit.

*Goal* If you have multiple options for one enchanting, what the most marginal
benefit you can get.
** TODO Combinatorial Maximum

*Goal* Given several enchanting, each with its own options, get a global
maximum.

* TODO DPS with All factor categories

Really needed?

* Detailed ActualDPS
*Overall NOTE:* A categorically hierarchical set of multipliers, factors within
the same category are aggregated additive.

| [[*SheetDPS][SheetDPS]] | [[*SkillWeaponDamageFactor][SkillDamageFactor]] | [[*ConditionalDamageFactor][ConditionalDamageFactor]] | ActualDPS |
|----------+-------------------+-------------------------+-----------|
|          |                   |                         |           |

** SheetDPS

What you see on the character details page.

| [[*BaseStatFactor][BaseStatFactor]] | [[*BaseDamageFactor][BaseDamageFactor]] | [[*CritFactor][CritFactor]] | [[*SkillDamageBonusFactor][SkillDamageBonusFactor]] | [[*SpeedFactor][SpeedFactor]] | SheetDPS |
|----------------+------------------+------------+------------------------+-------------+----------|
|                |                  |            |                        |             |          | 

*** BaseStatFactor

DEX, STR or INT depending on your class.

*** BaseDamageFactor

| [[*WeaponBaseDamageFactor][WeaponBaseDamageFactor]] | JewelryBaseDamageFactor | BaseDamageFactor |
|------------------------+-------------------------+------------------|
|                        |                         |                  |

**** WeaponBaseDamageFactor
The small damage number written on the weapon. Damage bonus from rubies in the
weapon socket are automatically factored into this number.

*Note* that the big white damage number is the average DPS computed from the
small damage number and the attacks per second.

*Also* dual wielding hits with only one weapon at the time and alternates
between them.

**** JewelryBaseDamageFactor

Just the damage number on the jewelry.

*** CritFactor

| CritChance | CritDamage | CritFactor (+ 100%) |
|------------+------------+---------------------|
|            |            |                     |

**** Useful Tips
On enchanting items, the =CritChance= and =CritDamage= has the ration of 1:10,
which, with some simple math, dictates that to get the best throughput you
should maintain this ration.

So to optimize the output, try to close down on the following value

Given =a= and =b= are =CritChance= and =CritDamage= separately, the best
possible adjustment should be:

\begin{align}
  \Delta c = \frac{a - b/10}{2}
  \\
  a' = a - \Delta c
  \\
  b' = b - 10\Delta c
\end{align}

*** SkillDamageBonusFactor

Certain skills (including Passive ones) can increase damage.

*** SpeedFactor

This is the one that changes this from a Damage Formula to a DPS formula.

| WeaponAttackRate | SpeedBonusFactor (+ 100%) | T |
|------------------+---------------------------+---|
|                  |                           |   |


**** TODO More complicated with Dual Wielding.

** SkillDamageFactor

| NativeSkillDamageFactor | SpecificSkillBonusFactor(+ 100%) | ElementalDamageFactor(+ 100%) | T |
|-------------------------+----------------------------------+-------------------------------+---|
|                         |                                  |                               |   |

** ConditionalDamageFactor

Many important factors are only effective under certain conditions. The are
multipliers on their own. These dynamics factors are what truly characterize a
battle.

The following is a list of known ones:

- =EliteDamageFactor=
- =StatusDamageFactor=
  
  Like the =Bastions of Rings=, which activates 8s 50% overall damage bonus for
  generator and spender each.
- =CombatConditionFactors=
  
  Many special effects fall into this category: distance between you and
  enemies, whether the enemy is under impairment control effect and etc.
